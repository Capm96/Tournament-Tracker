# Tournament Tracker
Tournament Tracker is a Winforms application that allows users to create and play through elimination-style tournaments. It allows users to create teams and prizes, and then proceeds to randomize matchups and create a tournament.

This is a project I worked on by following along the Tim Corey course on how to build a C# application from start to finish.

## What I learned through this course:
* Basic SQL (manipulating tables, creating stored procedures, handling connections).
* Creating a text file connection (.csv files, being able to convert them into objects in our script and vice-versa).
* Essentials of building Winforms (how to handle inputs, data validation, carrying data between forms).
* Re-emphasisis on principles of OOP programming (being able to create objects and re-use them for whatever our connection type, interface management, etc).
* Other useful topics (such as basic LINQ queries, e-mailing users from our script, and having the opportunity to do plenty of debugging!) 

(TODO) Here is the link for the application and some more information on it:
