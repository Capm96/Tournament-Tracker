# Tournament Tracker
Tournament Tracker is a Winforms application that allows users to create and play through elimination-style tournaments. 
It allows users to create team members, teams, prizes, and then proceeds to randomize the rounds and matchups to create a tournament.

## Credits
This is a project I worked on by following along Tim Corey's [course on how to build a C# application from start to finish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HalXZUHfKLA&list=PLLWMQd6PeGY3t63w-8MMIjIyYS7MsFcCi). 

Once the course was done I worked on implementing a few things:
* Added more exception handling methods throughout the application
* Created a new form to display tournament results once last match is played
* Modified UI of the application
* Adding the Squirrel NuGet package to the application so it can be downloaded
