# Tournament Tracker
Tournament Tracker is a Winforms application that allows users to create and play through elimination-style tournaments. 
It allows users to create team members, teams, prizes, and then proceeds to randomize the rounds and matchups to create a tournament.

## Credits
This is a project I worked on by following along Tim Corey's [course on how to build a C# application from start to finish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HalXZUHfKLA&list=PLLWMQd6PeGY3t63w-8MMIjIyYS7MsFcCi). 

Once the course was done I worked on implementing a few things:
* Added more exception handling methods throughout the application
* Created a new form to display tournament results once last match is played
* Modified UI of the application
* Adding the Squirrel NuGet package to the application so it can be downloaded

## What I learned through this course:
* Basic SQL (manipulating tables, creating stored procedures, handling connections).
* Creating a text file connection (.csv files, being able to convert them into objects in our script and vice-versa).
* Essentials of building Winforms (how to handle inputs, data validation, carrying data between forms).
* Re-emphasisis on principles of OOP programming (being able to create objects and re-use them for whatever our connection type, interface management, etc).
* Other useful topics (such as basic LINQ queries, e-mailing users from our script, and having the opportunity to do plenty of debugging!) 

## Download and Installation:
